# Song-Popularity_Prediction
We developed a model to predict popularity of a song on Spotify based on its characteristics such as tempo, energy, etc.

In this project, we combined two datasets, the popular songs of spotify during the years and the dataset of song characteristics.

We performed some EDA to better understand the data, cleaned the dataset, created a pipeline to do necessary data transformations(such as normalization and one-hot-encoding), performed an oversampling(since our data was way imbalanced with most songs being less popular), did a feature selection, and trained and evaluated 9 different ML algorithms.
